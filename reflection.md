- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

It's really helpful to linking classes which act the same under the same umbrella. I found it easier to understand how to create what was assigned since the superclass helped inform how each subclass was basically structured. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I felt like I understood a lot of this assignment. I'd like to have restocked only one item at a time in the Cafe class but they should still restock effectively the way I have it now. I would reccomend starting this early so you have time to take breaks when you're stuck on something.
